    ##
    # Exception used as standard error on this gem.
    # @param message.  This param is meant to be read by another developer
    #                  It would be nice if the message were self descriptive
    #                  enough so the developer won't need to ask the creator
    #                  of the app for help.
    # @param code.     The code is similar to message, but for this case
    #                  it is meant to be used for the program to handle
    #                  exceptions and to make easier to identify the exception..
    #                  The default is the exception class, so it won't change
    #                  almost never.
    # @param data.     Contains additional data to detail the error.
